        <h1> About the organization</h1>
        <p>This organization was established in 2025 by graduate students that recognized the suffering of university students. The institution is soley built on empathy and bringing hope to the youth who are lost in pursuing useless degrees. The therapists we offer are dedicated teams of unemployed graduates who can help teens build their future with example.</p>
